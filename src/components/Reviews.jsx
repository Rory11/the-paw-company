                <p>"Our two rats and one fish really seemed to enjoy there week with Amity!
                    Great at following instructions and super thoughtful towards both us and 
                    our animals, keeping us updated with pictures as requested. Would recommend 
                    to anyone interested in hiring a professional pet sitter." - Thomas G.
